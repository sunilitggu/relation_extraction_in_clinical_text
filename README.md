This is a code for the paper entitled "Relation extraction from clinical texts using domain invariant convolutional neural network" which have published in BioNLP at ACL-2016, Berlin, Germany

Dependencies: Python 2.7, Tensorflow, Numpy, nltk, sklearn, geniatagger

Dataset used in this work was partially availble here. For reproducing the results download complete datset from i2b2 challange with required standard Data Use Agreement and process it in given format.

PS: The code used here is the modified version of code shared by Denny Britz for sentence classification in his blog wildML http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/
